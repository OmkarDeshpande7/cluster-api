## Glossary

Refer to the [Cluster API Book Glossary](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/glossary.html).

- **Cluster API Runtime**: identifies the Cluster API execution model, a set of controllers cooperating in managing the 
  workload cluster’s lifecycle.
- **Runtime SDK**: a set of rules, recommendations and fundamental capabilities required to develop Runtime Hooks and 
  Runtime Extensions.
- **Runtime Hook**: a single, well identified, extension point allowing applications built on top of Cluster API to hook
  into specific moments of the workload cluster’s lifecycle, e.g. Cluster.BeforeUpgrade, Machine.BeforeRemediation.
- **Runtime Extension**: an external component which is part of a system/product built on top of Cluster API that can 
  handle requests for a specific Runtime Hook.

## Summary

This proposal introduces the Cluster API Runtime SDK, a set of rules, recommendations, and fundamental capabilities
required to implement a new extensibility mechanism that allows systems, products, and services built on top of
Cluster API to hook into a workload cluster’s lifecycle.

## Motivation

Extensibility is at the core of Cluster API.

CAPI extensibility originally was designed to allow infrastructure providers to offer their services via the Cluster API
declarative model; over time the same model has been extended to support bootstrap providers, control plane providers,
and more recently external remediation strategies.

But this is not enough anymore.

All the above extensibility points are about allowing plug-in, swappable “low-level” components required to
provision/manage a Kubernetes cluster with Cluster API.
Instead, with the growing adoption of Cluster API as a common layer to manage fleets of Kubernetes Clusters, there is
now a new category of systems, products and services built on top of Cluster API that require strict interactions
with the lifecycle of Clusters, but at the same time they do not want to replace any “low-level” components in
Cluster API, because they happily benefit from all the features available in the existing providers (built on top vs
plug-in/swap).  

A common approach for this problem has been to watch for Cluster API resources; another approach has been to implement
API Server admission webhooks to alter CAPI resources, but both approaches are limited by the fact that the system
built on top of Cluster API is forced to treat it as a opaque system and thus with limited visibility and almost
total lack of control, e.g. you can watch a Machine being provisioned, but not block the provisioning to start if
a quota management systems signals you have exhausted all the resources assigned to you.

A stop-gap solution to this problem has been introduced in Cluster API with the implementation of machine deletion
hooks, but this approach is tightly linked to the specific use case and it can not be re-used in other contexts/in
other lifecycle moments.

This proposal aims to solve the above problem in a more structured and generic way, by introducing the Runtime SDK,
a set of rules, recommendations and fundamental capabilities required to implement a new extensibility mechanism
that will allow systems, products and services built on top of Cluster API to hook in the workload cluster’s
lifecycle. 

The key elements of the above extensibility mechanism are Runtime Hooks and Runtime Extensions.

Runtime Hooks and Runtime Extensions are designed to be powerful and flexible, and _by opportunity_ it will be also
possible to use this capability for allowing the user to hook into Cluster API reconcile loops at "low level", e.g. 
by allowing a Runtime Extension providing external patches to be executed on every topology reconcile.

### Goals

To define the Runtime SDK and more specifically

- To define the rules ensuring Runtime Hooks can evolve over time:
  - When/how to create a new version;
  - When/how to modify the current version;
  - When/how to deprecate an old version, as well as mechanisms to inform users about versions being deprecated;
  - When/how to drop an old version, as well as providing a mechanism to prevent users to upgrade Cluster API when
    this will break installed Runtime Extensions;
- To define the fundamental capabilities/tooling to be implemented in CAPI in order to allow the implementation of
  Runtime Hooks.
- To provide an initial set of guidelines for Runtime Extension developers.
- To define how external Runtime Extensions can be registered within the Cluster API Runtime.

### Non-Goals

- To identify or specify the list of Runtime Hooks that should be implemented; some examples of possible Runtime Hooks
  will be eventually provided, but it is not in the scope of this document to define them in detail;
- To replace controllers or any other component of the Cluster API Runtime (including infrastructure providers,
  bootstrap providers, control plane providers and the CRD/contract based extension mechanism they rely on).

### Future Work

- Identify and specify the list of Runtime Hooks to be implemented; this will be addressed iteratively by a set of
  future proposals, all of them building on top of the foundational capabilities introduced by this document;
- Eventually consider deprecation of machine deletion hooks and replacement with a Runtime Hook;
- Improve the Runtime Extension developer guide based on experience and feedback;
- Add metrics about Runtime Extension calls (usage, usage vs deprecated versions, duration, error rate etc.);
- Allow providers to use the same SDK to define their own hooks.

## Proposal

### User Stories

- As a cluster operator I want to be able to execute a particular action in well-defined moments of the Workload
  Cluster’s lifecycle, e.g. 
  - As a cluster operator I want to automatically install the external CPI addon Before Upgrading the Cluster.
  - As a cluster operator I want to automatically check my quota management systems Before Creating a cluster.
  - As a cluster operator I want to automatically run Kubernetes conformance tests After a Cluster upgrade completes.
  - As a cluster operator I want to automatically back up persistent volumes Before deleting a cluster.
  - As a cluster operator I want to plug in a component that can provide externally generated patches while
    computing the Cluster topology (as a fully customizable alternative to inline JSON patches available in ClusterClass).

- As a developer building systems on top of Cluster API, I would like to have guarantees about the Runtime Extensions
  versions support, thus making it predictable and sustainable to keep up with new versions.

- As a developer building systems on top of Cluster API, I would like to implement a Runtime Extension in a
  simple way (simpler than writing controllers).

- As a developer building systems on top of Cluster API, I would like Runtime Extension to provide a certain degree
  of control on Cluster’s lifecycle, like e.g. block/defer an operation to start (the exact definition of the
  kind of control each Runtime Extension can have must be part of the corresponding Runtime Hook definition).

- As a developer building systems on top of Cluster API using Golang as a development language, I would like to
  leverage sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api as a library to speed up/ensure consistency in the implementation of
  my Runtime Extensions.

- As a developer building systems on top of Cluster API, I would like to have a way to dynamically add/remove/replace
  my Runtime Extensions once they are deployed.

This proposal considers also a set of additional user stories from the PoV of the Cluster API project maintainers:

- As a Cluster API maintainer I would like to provide reliable guarantees about the Runtime Hooks version support,
  thus making it possible for the project to continue to evolve in a way that is predictable for the developers
  implementing Runtime Extensions.

- As a Cluster API maintainer I would like to have a set of tools, utilities and conventions making it possible
  to implement new Runtime Hooks quickly and consistently across the code base.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

The proposed solution is designed with the intent to make developing Runtime Extensions as simple as possible, because
the success of this feature depends on its speed/rate of adoption in the ecosystem.

Accordingly, the proposed solution relies on a well-known, battle tested integration pattern, RESTful APIs.
A nice side effect of this choice is the possibility to leverage on a set api-machinery tooling and practices the
Cluster API maintainers are well-used to.

It is also important to notice that the model based on Runtime Hooks and Runtime Extensions implies two separate
personas being involved, each one with its own responsibilities in the process:

![overview](images/runtime-sdk/overview.png)

The Runtime SDK rules defined in this document are a critical element of the above split of responsibilities,
defining expectations for each of the above personas.

#### Cluster API Runtime Hooks vs Kubernetes admission webhooks

Runtime Hooks are inspired by Kubernetes admission webhooks, but there is one key difference that splits them apart:

- Admission webhooks are strictly linked to Kubernetes API Server/etcd **CRUD operations** e.g. Create or Update
  Cluster in etcd.
- Runtime Hooks can be used to define **arbitrary operations**, e.g. Cluster.BeforeUpgrade, Machine.Remediate etc.

In other words, Runtime Hooks are not concerned about “low-level” details of how Kubernetes handles objects in the
API Server/etcd; Runtime Hooks instead focus on “high-level” events of a Cluster’s lifecycle.

Please note that, no matter the similarities in some part of the design, users should not make assumptions about
Runtime Hooks having properties or behaviors typical of Kubernetes admission webhooks unless they are explicitly
defined in the following paragraphs.

#### Runtime SDK rules

As this proposal is based on RESTful APIs, we are using [OpenAPI Specification v3.0.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) [1] 
to document Runtime Hooks supported by Cluster API.

Most specifically, a single OpenAPI document providing specification for all the Runtime Hooks supported by a
Cluster API release will be added to the release artifacts; users can rely on https://editor.swagger.io/ or similar
tools to view the specification, and during implementation we will consider adding similar view to the Cluster API
book as well e.g.

![overview](images/runtime-sdk/swagger-ui.png)

Each Runtime Hook will be defined by one (or more) RESTful APIs implemented as a `POST` operation; each operation
is going to receive an input parameter as a request body, and return an output value as response body, both
`application/json` encoded and with a schema of arbitrary complexity that should be considered an integral part of
the Runtime Hook definition.

It is also worth noting that more than one version of the same Runtime Hook might be supported at the same time;
e.g. in the example above the `Cluster.BeforeUpgrade` Hook exist in version `v1alpha1` (old version)
and `v1alpha2` (current).

Supporting more versions at the same time is a requirement in order to:

- Allow Cluster API maintainers to continue to develop and evolve Runtime Hooks in a predictable way.
- Provide a well-defined set of guarantees to Runtime Extension implementers they can rely on while developing
  solutions on top of CAPI.

In their simplest form guarantees for Runtime Hook versions are:

- Once a Runtime Hook version has been published, breaking changes are not allowed without bumping to a new version
  (e.g. fields removal/renaming)
- Before removing a Runtime Hook version, a deprecation period should be respected, with a duration depending
  on the maturity of the API itself (12 Months/3 Versions GA, 6M/2V beta, 0 alpha).

The formal definition of the Runtime SDK rules derived from https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/,
can be found in the annex at the end of the document. Please note that during implementation we will consider a
mechanism allowing to:

- Inform admins about Runtime Extension using a deprecated version of a Runtime Hook (e.g. return a well known
  HTTP header, set a condition on the RuntimeExtensionConfiguration object defined in the following paragraphs,
  webhook warnings on RuntimeExtensionConfiguration create/update).
- Prevent upgrades to new Cluster API versions that makes configured Runtime Extension not functional due to
  the expiration of the deprecation period (e.g. implement a preflight check in the `clusterctl upgrade` command
  or a validation webhook, if possible).

[1] This is the most recent OpenAPI Specification supported by https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-openapi

## Runtime Extensions developer guide

As a developer building systems on top of Cluster API, if you want to hook in the Cluster’s lifecycle via
a Runtime Hook, you are required to implement a Runtime Extension handling requests according to the
OpenAPI specification for the Runtime Hook you are interested in.

Runtime Extensions by design are very powerful and flexible, however given that with great power comes
great responsibility, a few key consideration should always be kept in mind (more details in the following paragraphs):

- Runtime Extension are components that should be designed, written and deployed with great caution given that they
  can affect the proper functioning of the Cluster API runtime.
- Cluster administrators should carefully vet any Runtime Extension registration, thus preventing malicious components
  from being added to the system.

Please note that following similar practices is already commonly accepted in the Kubernetes ecosystem for
Kubernetes API server admission webhooks, and Runtime Extensions share the same foundation and most of the same
considerations/concerns apply.

### Implementing Runtime Extensions

As a developer building systems on top of Cluster API, if you want to hook in the Cluster’s lifecycle via a
Runtime Extension, you are required to implement an HTTP server handling a discovery request and a set of 
additional requests according to the OpenAPI specification for the Runtime Hook you are interested in.

E.g.

```go
// Note: this is pseudo code, meant to demonstrate that implementing a RuntimeExtension requires only minimal scaffolding;
// the exact details will be defined during implementation, possibly taking advantage of Golang generics.

var c = catalog.NewCatalog()

func init() {
    v1alpha2.AddToCatalog(c)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()

    listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", net.JoinHostPort("127.0.0.1", "8082"))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Build an HTTP handler for a given operation, calling a strongly typed func at each request
    beforeUgradeHandler, err := catalogHTTP.NewHandlerBuilder().
        WithCatalog(c).
        AddService(&v1alpha2.DiscoveryHook{}, doDiscovery).
        AddService(&v1alpha2.BeforeUgradeHook{}, doBeforeUpgrade).
        Build()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    srv := &http.Server{
        Handler: BeforeUgradeHandler,
    }
    if err := srv.Serve(listener); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
        panic(err)
    }
}

func doDiscovery(in *v1alpha2.DiscoveryInput, out *v1alpha2.DiscoveryOutput) error {
    out.Items = append(out.Items,
        *v1alpha2.DiscoveryExtension{
            name: "upgradeAddons",
            hook: *v1alpha2.DiscoveryHook{
                apiVersion: "hook.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1",
                name: "BeforeUpgrade",
            },
            timeoutSeconds: 5,
            failurePolicy: *v1alpha2.FailurePolicyFail,
    }) 
    return nil
}

func doBeforeUpgrade(in *v1alpha2.BeforeUpgradeInput, out *v1alpha2.BeforeUpgradeOutput) error {
    // your actual implementation...
    return nil
}
```

Please note that each runtime extension server could answer to different hooks calls (in the
example above `Discovery` and `BeforeUpgrade`) each one of them handled at different path, like API server does
for the different API resources. The exact format of those paths will be defined during the implementation
and this document updated accordingly.

[Discovery](#discovery-hook) is an operation that allows each runtime extension server to inform Cluster API of the
list of Runtime Extension it implements, their version and other features.

Please note that Cluster API only enforces input and output parameters types as defined by a Runtime Hook version,
and developers are fully responsible for all the other elements of the design of a Runtime Extension implementation,
including:

- To choose which programming language to use; please note that for sake of this proposal Golang is the language
  of choice, and we are not planning to test/provide tooling/libraries for other languages. Nevertheless, given that
  we rely on Open API and plain HTTP(s) calls, other languages should just work but support will be provided at
  best effort.
- To choose if to have a dedicated HTTP server(s) for Runtime Extensions only or if to use the HTTP server for other
  purposes as well (e.g. metric endpoint).

In case the Runtime Extension is being developed in Golang, the implementer can benefit from importing
`sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api` as show in the example above and:

- Use Golang types defined under `/runtime` (the types from which the OpenAPI specification has been generated).
- Use the RuntimeExtension catalog object to generate the skeleton of the HTTP handler for a given Runtime extension.
  The generated func will take care of scaffolding tasks like Marshal/Unmarshal; the only missing part will be to
  implement a strongly typed func that contains the actual extension implementation.

While writing the actual code of the Runtime Extension a set of important guidelines must be considered:

#### Timeouts
Runtime Extension processing adds to network request latency, they should run as quickly as possible
(typically in milliseconds); Cluster Administrator will be allowed to configure how long the Cluster API Runtime
should wait for a Runtime Extension to respond before treating the call as a failure (max 10s).

####  Availability
Runtime Extension failure could result in errors in handling Workload’s Clusters lifecycle, and so the implementation
should be robust, have proper error handling, avoid panics, etc.; It will be allowed to set up
failure policies preventing a Runtime Extension failure to have negative effects on the Cluster API Runtime, but
this option can’t be used in all the use cases. see [Error Management](#error-management)

####  Blocking Hooks
A Runtime Hook can be defined as "blocking", e.g. the BeforeClusterUpgrade hook allows a Runtime Extension
to prevent the upgrade to start.

A Runtime Extension registered for the above hook will be allowed to block by retuning a `retryAfterSeconds` value.
Following consideration apply:

- The system might decide to retry the same Runtime Extension even before the `retryAfterSeconds` period expires,
  e.g. due to other changes in the Cluster, so retry after should be considered as an approximate maximum
  time before the next reconcile.
- If there is more than one Runtime Extension registered for the same Runtime Hook and more than one returns
  `retryAfterSeconds`, the shortest one will be used.
- If there is more than one Runtime Extension registered for the same Runtime Hook and at least one returns
  `retryAfterSeconds`, all the Runtime Extension be executed when the operation will be re-tried.

Detailed description of what "blocking" means for each specific Runtime Hooks will be documented case by case.

#### Side Effects
It is recommended that Runtime Extensions should avoid side effects if possible, which means to operate only on
the content of the Input/Output sent to them, and not make out-of-band changes.
If side effects are required, rules defined in the following paragraphs apply.

#### Idempotence
An idempotent Runtime Extension is able to successfully accomplish its task also in case it has already been completed
(the Runtime Extension checks current state and changes it only if necessary). 

A practical example that explains why idempotence is relevant is the fact that extension could be called more than once 
for the same lifecycle transition, e.g.

- Two RuntimeExtension are registered for the BeforeUpgrade hook.
- Before a Cluster upgrades both extensions are called, but one of them temporarily block the operation asking to retry after 30s.
- After 30s the system retries the lifecycle transition, and both the extensions are called again to re-evaluate
  if it is now possible to proceed with Cluster upgrade.

#### Avoid dependencies
Each Runtime Extension should accomplish its task without dependency or relations with other Runtime Extensions.
Introducing dependencies across Runtime Extensions makes the system fragile, and it is probably a consequence of
poor “Separation of Concerns” while designing such components.

#### Deterministic result
A deterministic Runtime Extension is implemented in such a way that given the same input it will always return
the same output.

Some Runtime Hook, like e.g. external patches, might explicitly request for corresponding 
Runtime Extensions to support this property, but we encourage developers to follow 
this pattern more generally given that it fits well with practices like unit testing and
generally makes the entire system more predictable and easier to troubleshoot.

####  Error Management
In case a Runtime Extension returns an error, the error will be handled according to the corresponding FailurePolicy
defined in the response to the Discovery call.

If the failure policy is `Ignore` the error is going to be recorded in controller's logs, but the processing will continue;
however we recognize that this failure policy cannot be used in most of the use cases because Runtime Extension
implementers want to ensure that some task is completed before continuing with the cluster's lifecycle.

If instead the failure policy is `Fail` the system will retry the operation until it passes.
Following general considerations apply:

- It is responsibility of Cluster API components to surface RuntimeExtension errors using conditions.
- Operations will be retried with an exponential backoff or whenever the state of Cluster changes (we are going to rely
  on controller runtime exponential backoff/watches).
- If the operation is defined as "blocking", the error is going to block a lifecycle transition,
  e.g. an error on a Runtime Extension for the BeforeClusterUpgrade hook is going to block the Cluster upgrade to start.
- If there is more than one Runtime Extension registered for the same Runtime Hook and at least one of them fails,
  all the registered Runtime Extension will be retried. see [Idempotence](#idempotence)

Additional consideration about errors that apply to a specific Runtime Hooks only will be documented case by case.

### Deploy Runtime Extensions
Cluster API requires that each Runtime Extension must be deployed using an endpoint accessible from the Cluster API
controllers; additionally, Runtime Extensions must always be executed out of process (not in the same process as
the Cluster API runtime).

This proposal assumes that the default solution that implementers are going to adopt is to deploy Runtime Extension
in the Management Cluster by:

- Packing the Runtime Extension in a container image;
- Using a Kubernetes Deployment to run the above container inside the Management Cluster;
- Using a Cluster IP service to make the Runtime Extension instances accessible via a stable DNS name;
- Using a cert-manager generated Certificate to protect the endpoint.

There are a set of important guidelines that must be considered while choosing the deployment method:

#### Availability
It is recommended that Runtime Extensions should leverage some form of load-balancing, to provide high availability
and performance benefits; you can run multiple Runtime Extension backends behind a service to leverage the
load-balancing that services support.

#### Identity and access management
The security model for each Runtime Extensions should be carefully defined, similar to any other application deployed
in the Cluster: the deployment must use a dedicated service account with limited RBAC permission.

On top of that, the container image for the Runtime Extension should be carefully designed in order to avoid
privilege escalation (e.g using [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) base images) and
the Pod spec in the Deployment manifest should enforce security best practices (e.g. do not use privileged pods etc.).

####  Alternative deployments methods
Alternative deployment methods can be used given that the requirement about the HTTP endpoint accessibility
is satisfied, like e.g.

- deploying the HTTP Server as a part of another component, e.g. a controller;
- deploying the HTTP Server outside the Management Cluster.

In these cases above recommendations about availability and identity and access management apply as well.

### Registering Runtime Extensions

_Important! Cluster administrators should carefully vet any Runtime Extension registration, thus preventing
malicious components from being added to the system._

_Creating RuntimeExtensionConfiguration will be allowed only if the Runtime Extension feature flag is set to true._

By registering a Runtime Extension the Cluster API Runtime becomes aware of a Runtime Extension implementing a
Runtime Hook, and as a consequence the runtime starts calling the extension at well-defined moments of the
workload cluster’s lifecycle.

This process has many similarities with registering dynamic webhooks in Kubernetes, but some specific 
behavior is introduced by this proposal:

The Cluster administrator is required to register available Runtime Extension server using the following CR

```yaml
apiVersion: runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: "my-amazing-extensions"
spec:
  clientConfig:
    #`url` gives the location of the RuntimeExtension, in standard URL form (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be specified.
    url: "..."
    service:
      namespace: "example-namespace"
      name: "example-service"
      # `path` is an optional path prefix path which can be sent in any request to this service.
      path: "runtime-extensions/"
      # If specified, the port on the service that hosts the RuntimeExtension. Default to 443. `port` should be a valid port number (1-65535, inclusive).
      port: 8082
    caBundle: "..."
  # NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on a Cluster based on whether the namespace for that Cluster matches the selector.
  # If not specified, the WebHook runs for all the namespaces.
  namespaceSelector: {}
```

Once the extension is registered the [discovery hook](#discovery-hook) is called and the above CR is updated with the list
of the Runtime Extensions supported by the server.

```yaml

apiVersion: runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: "my-amazing-extensions"
spec:
  ...
status:
  runtimeExtensions: ## Details of supported runtime extensions
  - name: "http-proxy.my-amazing-extensions" # unique name, computed
    hook:
      apiVersion: "hook.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1"
      name: "generatePatches"
    timeoutSeconds: 5 # Timeout to be used when calling the extension. Max timeout allowed 10s.   
    failurePolicy: Fail # FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors from the admission endpoint are handled - allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Fail.
  - ...
  conditions:
    ...
```

As you can notice, each Runtime Extension is given a unique identifier that can be used to reference it from other
part of the system, e.g. from ClusterClass. Additionally, it is documented the exact reference to the hook/version
the Runtime Extension is implementing as well as the failurePolicy and the timeout the system should use when 
calling the extension.

If consensus is reached/in a follow-up iteration we consider to eventually add support for defining
Runtime Extensions that applies to a subset of Clusters/object only, by adding to the CR used for registration the
following field:

```yaml
# ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook on objects (e.g. Clusters) based on whether the Cluster object matches the selector.
# If not specified, the WebHook runs for all the objects.
objectSelector:
...

```

Instead, unless there's a strong and evident need for it, we are not considering adding support for defining 
dependencies among Runtime Extensions, being it modeled with something similar to 
[systemd unit options](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) or alternative approaches.

The main reason behind that is that such type of feature introduces complexity and creates "pet" like relations across
components making the overall system more fragile. This is also consistent with the [avoid dependencies](#avoid-dependencies) 
recommendation above.

## Runtime Hooks developer guide (CAPI internals)

_Following notes provide details about how Runtime Hook will be implemented in the Cluster API codebase;
if you are not interested in CAPI internals you can skip this section._

### Runtime hook implementation

The process of implementing the new Runtime Hooks is intentionally designed in order to mimic the steps currently
used to define API types, thus providing a familiar experience to the maintainers/the people used to look at the
Cluster API codebase. Most specifically:

- Runtime Hooks versions must be defined under a `/runtime` folder.
- For each Runtime Hook, there must be one version, each one defined in its own folder e.g. `/v1alpha1`, `/v1alpha2` etc.
- Eventually we can have further grouping by "area" (TBD during implementation).

```
/runtime
└── contract
    ├── cluster
    │   ├── v1alpha1
    │   └── v1alpha2
    └── controlplane
        └── v1alpha3
```

Each version folder must

- Define a group version
- Provide type definitions for the RuntimeHook and its input/output parameters.

```
/runtime/contract/cluster/v1alpha1
├── groupversion_info.go
└── before_upgrade_types.go
```

Type definitions are standard golang type definitions with golang json tags and a set of additional k8s/kubebuilder
markers triggering code generators for:

- DeepCopy func, making input/output parameters types to satisfy the runtime.object interface.
- Conversion func from older releases of the Runtime Hook input/output parameters types to the latest one.
- OpenAPI schema’s definition for each type.

```go
// +k8s:openapi-gen=true
// +kubebuilder:object:root=true
type BeforeUpgradeInput struct {
metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
  ...
}
```

The code generators are https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools and https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-openapi; 
the expected output will be something similar to:

```
/runtime/contract/cluster/v1alpha1
├── groupversion_info.go
├── before_upgrade_types.go
├── zz_generated.conversion.go
├── zz_generated.deepcopy.go
└── zz_generated.openapi.go
```

Similarly to what happens for API types and api-machinery schema, the type definitions inside every version folder
have to be added to a **catalog**, but with few notable differences:

- The Runtime Hooks tracks mapping between a group/version/hook and its own corresponding input/output types
  (group/version/input-kind and group/version/output-kind).
- Type conversions are allowed between objects with the same group/hook (instead of being in a “flat type-space”
  like in the api-machinery schema).

_Note: this is pseudo code, meant to demonstrate that registering an Runtime Hook is similar to registering an API type;
the exact details will be defined during implementation._

```go
var (
    // GroupVersion is group version identifying Runtime Hooks defined in this package
    // and their request and response types.
    GroupVersion = catalog.GroupVersion{Group: "cluster.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io", Version: "v1alpha1"}

    // catalogBuilder is used to add Runtime Hooks and their input and output types
    // to a Catalog.
    catalogBuilder = catalog.NewBuilder(GroupVersion)

    // AddToCatalog adds Runtime Hooks defined in this package and their input and
    // output types to a catalog.
    AddToCatalog = catalogBuilder.AddToCatalog

    // localSchemeBuilder provides access to the SchemeBuilder used for managing Runtime Hooks
    // input and output types defined in this package.
    // NOTE: this object is required to allow registration of automatically generated
    // conversions func.
    localSchemeBuilder = catalogBuilder.SchemeBuilder
)

func init() {
    // Add Open API definitions for Runtime Hooks input and output types in this package
    // NOTE: the GetOpenAPIDefinitions func is automatically generated by openapi-gen.
    catalogBuilder.OpenAPIDefinitions(GetOpenAPIDefinitions)

    // Register Runtime Hooks defined in this package and their input and output types.
    catalogBuilder.RegisterHook(&BeforeUgradeHook{}, &BeforeUgradeInput{}, &BeforeUgradeOutput{})
}
```

Given the above definitions, a catalog can finally be created as follow:

```go
var c = catalog.NewCatalog()

func init() {
    v1alpha1.AddToCatalog(c)
    v1alpha2.AddToCatalog(c)
    v1alpha3.AddToCatalog(c)
}
```

The catalog provides the core knowledge required to manage all the Runtime Hooks supported by Cluster API;
the first application of such knowledge will be to retrieve all the info required to generate the OpenAPI specification
for Runtime Hooks with a dedicated tool under `hack/tools`.

### Discovering Runtime Extensions

_Note: the controller described in this paragraph will be executed only if the Runtime Extension feature flag is set to true._

Cluster API is going to implement a new controller that looks at Runtime Extension Configurations; the main
responsibility of this controller should be to maintain an internal, shared **registry** of available extensions
at a given time.

Please note that the Runtime Extensions registry also provides a single point to centralize a set of common behaviors
supporting interaction with those external components, thus making the adoption of this feature scalable - 
in the sense of being used for an increasing numbers of use cases in Cluster API - while operating consistently
across the board.

A first behavior that falls into this category is the implementation of exponential backoff mechanisms
in case of errors, thus preventing Cluster API from creating pressure on HTTP Servers recovering from or with
ongoing operational issues.

Another cross-cutting concern is about ensuring that Runtime Extensions, which are external components triggered
in the middle of Cluster API controllers logic, do not block the reconciliation process indefinitely 
(e.g by enforcing a maximum timeout for all the Runtime Extensions calls).

### Calling Runtime Extensions

_Note: the code described in this paragraph will be executed only if the Runtime Extension feature flag is set to true._

Cluster API is going to implement calls to registered Runtime Extensions at well-known moments of the Cluster’s lifecycle.

The two key elements that make the implementation of runtime extension calls simple and consistent across
the codebase are:

- The Runtime Hook catalog, providing the info about all the defined Runtime Hooks, supported version and
  corresponding input/output types;
- The Runtime Extensions registry, providing info about the registered Runtime Extensions implementing the
  Runtime Hooks defined above.

Given these two elements, the code for calling Runtime Extensions is:

_Note: this is pseudo code, meant to demonstrate a set of elements described below the example; the exact details
will be defined during implementation, possibly taking advantage of golang generics._

```go
extensions := registry.Get(
    registry.Group("cluster.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2”),
    registry.Hook(&v1alpha2.BeforeUgradeHook{}),
)

for _, e := range extensions{
    client := catalogHTTP.NewClientBuilder().
        WithCatalog(c).
        Host(e.host).
        Build()

    hook := &v1alpha2.BeforeUgradeHook{}
    in := &v1alpha2.BeforeUgradeInput{First: 1, Second: "Hello CAPI Runtime Extensions!"}
    out := &v1alpha2.BeforeUgradeOutput{}
    if err := client.Extension(hook, catalogHTTP.SpecVersion(r.version)).Invoke(ctx, in, out); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Do something with the output e.g. proceed with upgrade or block
}
```

A couple of elements are worth noting:

- Registered Runtime Extensions are returned by group and hook; this will also include Runtime Extensions
  implementing older versions of the same Runtime Hook;
- The call is implemented using the last version of the Runtime Hook/Input/Output types; the Invoke function
  will take care of version conversions, if required.

## Security Model

Following threats were considered:

- Malicious Runtime Extensions being registered 

Mitigation: The same mitigations used for avoiding malicious dynamic webhooks in Kubernetes apply
(defining RBAC rules for the RuntimeExtensionConfiguration assigning this responsibility to cluster admin only).

- Privilege escalation of HTTP Servers running Runtime Extensions

Mitigation: The same mitigations used for any HTTP server deployed in Kubernetes apply
(use distroless base image, do not use privileged pods etc.).

- Tampering of the communication channel between Cluster API controllers and HTTP Servers implementing Runtime Extensions.

Mitigation: The same mitigations used for any HTTP server deployed in Kubernetes apply (use SSL, Network policies etc.).

## Risks and Mitigations

- Building Runtime SDK, Runtime Hooks and Runtime Extensions in sequential steps might lead to reworks.

This is an accepted risk, given the importance of defining a robust SDK before external developers start relying
extensively on this feature.

## Alternatives

- Using in-process plugins vs calling external components

Plugins has been considered (golang native plugins, grpc plugins with https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin
and also webassembly) but the option has been discarded given that this approach could introduce instability –
due to external components running alongside Cluster API components – and also has a more complex threat model,
given that those components could potentially inherit and exploit the permission given to Cluster API components.

- Using grpc instead of RESTful APIs.

Even if grpc could provide some advantages in terms of performance, the option has been discarded given that
using RESTful APIs it is easier to implement a framework that mimics Kubernetes APIs (do not reinvent the wheel,
leverage on api-machinery, controller tools, kube-openapi, provide a familiar developer experience).

## Upgrade Strategy

This proposal does not affect Cluster API providers or Cluster API cluster’s upgrade strategy or version skew.
However, rules for evolving Runtime Hook across Cluster API versions are introduced.

## Additional Details

### Test Plan

While in alpha phase it is expected that the Runtime SDK will have unit tests covering all the main components: 
catalog, discovery controller, tooling.

With the increasing adoption of this feature, we expect more unit tests, integration tests and  E2E tests
to be added covering specific Runtime Hooks.

### Graduation Criteria

Main criteria for graduating this feature is adoption; further detail about graduation criteria will be added
in future iterations of this document.

### Version Skew Strategy

See upgrade strategy.

## Annex

### Runtime SDK rules

**Rule #1: Runtime Hooks and input/output parameter elements may only be removed by incrementing the version of the
Runtime Hook.**

Once a Runtime Hook or a Runtime Hook input/output parameter element has been added to a particular version,
it can not be removed from that version or have its behavior significantly changed.

**Rule #2 Runtime Hook’s input parameters must be down-convertible, output parameters must be up-convertible.
Most specifically**

- input parameters must be able to be down-converted from the latest version to previous versions of the same
  Runtime Hook; this might imply information loss, but the behavior of the previous version of the Runtime Hook
  must not be affected by this.
- output parameters must be able to be up-converted from previous versions to current versions of the same
  Runtime Hook; this means that new information should be nullable or have defaults.

For example assume that we have a Cluster.BeforeUpgrade Runtime Hook with version `v1alpha1` and `v1alpha2`; 
In order to avoid duplicating code, Cluster API internally will always work at the latest version, `v1alpha2` 
in the example, but there could be still a deployed Runtime Extension on `v1alpha1`.

This rule makes it possible to call the Runtime Extensions still using the `v1alpha1` by ensuring it is possible
to down-converting the input parameter for the `v1alpha2` call implemented in CAPI, make the call, and then 
up-converting the `v1alpha1` output parameter to the v1alpha2 version `CAPI` expects.

**Rule #3: A Runtime Hook version in a given track may not be deprecated until a new version at least as stable
is released.**

GA Runtime Hook versions can replace GA or beta Runtime Hook versions; beta Runtime Hook versions may not replace
GA Runtime Hook API versions etc.

**Rule #4: Other than the most recent Runtime Hook versions in each track, older Runtime Hook versions must
be supported after their announced deprecation for a duration of no less than:

- GA: 12 months or 3 releases (whichever is longer)
- Beta: 6 months or 2 releases (whichever is longer)
- Alpha: 0 releases
  **

### Discovery hook

The Discovery hook must be implemented by all the Runtime Extensions servers, and it is responsible to
inform the system about the Runtime Extensions it implements.

When invoked the discovery hook is expected to provide the following answer:

```yaml
status: Success # or Failure
message: "error message if status == failure"
items: # Info about implemented runtime extensions
- name: http-proxy     # Unique name identifying the runtime extension
  hook:
    apiVersion: "hook.runtime.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1"
    name: "generatePatches"
  timeoutSeconds: 5    # Default value suggested by the RuntimeExtension developers
  failurePolicy: Fail  # Default value suggested by the RuntimeExtension developers 
- ...
```

Please note that the above struct supports defining more than one Runtime Extension for the same hook, e.g.
defining more than one "generatePatches" extensions.
